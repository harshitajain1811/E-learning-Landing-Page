# Landing Page UI/UX Development for Startup "GrowSpace"

Project Overview:
We are launching a new startup called GrowSpace (focused on online learning), and we need a simple, clean landing page developed based on a basic wireframe we will provide.
The design should feel modern, minimalistic, and mobile-responsive.

Page Sections:
1) Hero section (with headline, subheadline, and CTA button)
2) About us section
3) Features / Benefits section (3 columns or cards)
4) Testimonials slider (optional basic version)
5) Newsletter signup form
6) Footer with links
